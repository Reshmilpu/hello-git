Q.1- What is an access token? Generate your access token for any API.(for example Twitter,Spotify etc).

=>The Access Token is a credential that can be used by an application to access an API.

It can be any type of token (such as an opaque string or a JWT) and is meant for an API. Its purpose is to inform the API that the bearer of this token has been authorized to access the API and perform specific actions (as specified by the scope that has been granted).

The Access Token should be used as a Bearer credential and transmitted in an HTTP Authorization header to the API.

Access Token format
Auth0 currently generates Access Tokens in two formats: as opaque strings or as JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

This depends on the value that the audience parameter has in the authorization request.





Q.2- Get the IP address of some common sites like Google, Facebook by using DNS lookup.

=>Google :172.217.9.164
=>Facebook:157.240.18.35





Q.3- Using Tweepy library try to extract tweets from Twitter.
=>
import tweepy, re, operator
from paralleldots import set_api_key, sentiment


consumer_key = '' # Authentication Consumer Key's
consumer_secret = ''


access_token = ''  # Authentication Access Tokens
access_token_secret = ''


oauth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
oauth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)

api = tweepy.API(oauth)


def get_tweet():
    hash_tag = input("\nEnter the word without the hashtag")
    hash_tag = "#" + hash_tag
    tweets = api.search(hash_tag)
    return tweets


   
Q.4- What is a difference between library and API . Figure it out with examples.
Library is written in same language which is a collection of all the functionalities
required for the use case.
A library is a collection of functions / objects that serves one particular purpose.
you could use a library in a variety of projects. (Various specialized services in our case).
A library is a collection of sources of information and similar resources, made accessible
to a defined community for reference or borrowing.
               A Library is a chunk of code that you can call from your own code, to help you
do things more quickly/easily. For example, a Bitmap Processing library will provide facilities
for loading and manipulating bitmap images, saving you having to write all that code for yourself. 


for example:-Numpy is a library of Python, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and
matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.



API is a part of library which defines how an application communicates with external code
API can be written in any language.
An API is an interface for other programs to interact with your program or library
without having direct access. ( giving specifications for our need to various vendors in our case).
An API (Application Programming Interface) are the functions/methods (the front-end code) in a library
that you can call to ask it to do things for you â€“ the interface to the library.
                Android API to interact with hardware, like the front camera of an Android-based device.
If your app needs to vibrate the phone, you must use the Android API method like vibratePhone().
We can create our own APIs using Python Framework like Django and Flask which can be used in websites.


Q.5- Try to access Spotify API . Find out some library for it and play some music.


#access spotify API 
import sys
import subprocess
import os
import spotipy
import pprint
import spotipy.util as util
if len(sys.argv) > 2:
    username = sys.argv[1]
    playlist_name = sys.argv[2]
 
    playlist_description = sys.argv[3]
else:
    print("Usage: %s username playlist-name playlist-description" % (sys.argv[0],))
    sys.exit()
token = util.prompt_for_user_token(username)
if token:
    sp = spotipy.Spotify(auth=token)
    sp.trace = False
    playlists = sp.user_playlist_create(username, playlist_name,
                                        playlist_description)
    pprint.pprint(playlists)
else:
    print("Can't get token for", username)
